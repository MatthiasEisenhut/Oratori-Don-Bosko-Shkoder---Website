            The Oratory - Don Bosco Youth Center of Shkodër is a community that offers every young
            person the opportunity to be part of Don Bosco's dream, to be in this world young
            bearers of faith, hope and charity.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body1">
            Inspired by the Preventive System and the Salesian pedagogy, the oratory is, in the
            heart of this city, a healthy and educational environment that aims to be the leaven of
            a society founded on harmony, respect and love.

            Through the various recreational and formative activities, the oratory is a joyful
            courtyard in which to build new and healthy friendships; a house with open doors, ready
            to welcome each person with all the dreams that are inscribed in his heart; a church
            that educates in faith and respect for the different religions that inhabit our
            environment; and a school of life, which prepares and brings out the best in each
            person, especially through the formation groups and the training for animators and

            Formation groups are the heart of the Oratorian experience. Through weekly meetings, we

            development. A dynamic proposal, which also includes spaces for listening, celebration,
            study, dialogue and fun.

            We firmly believe in the heart of each young person. We know that each person has a

            and joy, because, just as it has made us happy, we want it to show every young person
            the way to true happiness.
